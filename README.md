#What I learned 
This demonstrates the encoding and decoding process using the provided sample text files. 
The script encodes the words in plain_text.txt using the mappings from secret_key.txt, then decodes 
the encoded lines back to the original words using the same secret key mappings.

Implementation of:

File Handling: Reading from and writing to text files (open, read, write).
String Manipulation: Splitting strings (split(), strip()) and concatenating strings.
Data Structures: Using dictionaries ({}) to create mappings between words.
Encoding and Decoding: Demonstrates a simple form of encoding and decoding using a mapping (in this case, a substitution cipher) to encode text and then decode it back.
Functions and Modularization: The code is divided into functions (encode, decode, simulation, main) for better organization and reusability.
User Interaction: Accepts user input and displays output based on those inputs (input() and printing messages).
Control Flow: Uses loops (for loops) to iterate over lines and words in the text files.
